This Python script provides a simplified food ordering system using a command-line interface. It initializes a menu with items and their respective prices and allows users to add items to their order by entering the corresponding item number. The script continuously prompts the user for input until they decide to quit by entering 'go'. Finally, it displays the list of ordered items and the total cost, ensuring a smooth and interactive user experience.
